How it Works
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Create an application token for the github API
    * Account Settings > Applications > Personal Access Tokens (Needs to be able to read public/private repos and maybe notifications)
    * Save it to a .token file

*  The code is set to use my account, change it to use someone elses to match above token
* run
