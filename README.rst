How it Works
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Create an application token for the github API
    * Account Settings > Applications > Personal Access Tokens (Needs to be able to read public/private repos and maybe notifications)
    * Save it to a .token file

* run clone_github_org_repos.sh, it will save to a subdir in this repo that is ignored by the above git repo. or change the path to somewhere else
